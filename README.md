Waya Pay Chat is a social iOS application that includes payment system as well to enhance easy payment during conversations.
this project was designed to solve the problem of having to leave a conversation or an app to enter a bank app to make transfers or complete a transaction.
## Problem and Solution
It has often been a discomfort leaving a social app in the middle of a chat with probably a vendor or a bussiness partner to open a bank app in other to complete a transaction, screenshot receipt then come back to the chat app to send as a picture.
Waya Paychat is designed to remove this Hassle, it is disgned to merge both amazing chat functionalities and payment system.
This solution is only available on mobile (Android and iOS).
## Conception
I (Nwudo Anthony Chukwuebuka) was contracted solely to start and finish the project, this project was estimated for 4 months, i have spent 3 months on it and its 85% done already.
##Architecture
I followed MVVM pattern in the course of development, I chose this because I might not be the one maintaining the code base in the future. and I think most engineers are comfortable with MVVM and also Reactive approach of programming seems to be the new normal.
I also used Coordinator partern for navigations in other to reduce the work/responsibility of the view layer.
